# Incrementally Migrating to Remix

The [Remix](https://remix.run) gang created a [great guide](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/migrating-react-router-app) and [demo app](https://github.com/kentcdodds/incremental-react-router-to-remix-upgrade-path) showing how to incrementally migrate an app from React Router to Remix.

This repo explores other app types, providing high level guides and demos showcasing how to incrementally migrate anything to Remix ðŸ™‚. To see the demos in action, check out my [Remix Conf talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_nxvVTNY9s&t=25590s).
